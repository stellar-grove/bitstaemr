## PERT
Project Evaluation Review Techinique (PERT) is a method of performing management engineering to create an on-arc activity networks based on a series of milestones and activities.  The user is able to choose between several distributions which best suit their need.

## biostats
This simulator creates both individual patients as well as cohorts containing several different features.  Features are created based on these categories: Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, BMI, Physical Activity, Smoking Status, Family History, Diabetes, Medical History, SWLS, PSS, STAI. <br>

Users can specify whether they are creating a singular patient or a cohort of any size.

## MSP
The simulators done here feed off the Modelling and Simulation using Python book.  In order to use this package you need to clone the modsimpy repository from github.

## planetaryorbit
The planetaryorbit simulator aims to create data to simulate how the planets move around the sun.

## MarkovPlaysTetris
MCMC modelling is the name of the game in this class.  This class can be used to run Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations for any distribution passed to it.

## GrokSays
This class is a research class.  Ultimately it all starts from code that I ask Grok to create.  Some of it works, some of it doesn't.  Anything that doesn't work straight out of the gate is remediated.  So far it's hitting around 50/50 needing to be remediated vs not.

## FlightPath
This simulator models the flight path of an object.
<br><br>[home](#navigation)

## HIV
The HIV class aims to simulate HIV and how it acts.
<br><br>[home](#navigation)

## Bacteria
The backteria simulator aims to simulate how bacteria grow given certain conditions.
<br><br>[home](#navigation)

## TaxiCab
To model the route of a taxi cab in a city, use this simulator.
<br><br>[home](#navigation)

## Distance
To simulate how far an object would travel.
<br><br>[home](#navigation)

## Baseball
Simulates a baseball game given certain criteria.  End state will be to pull data from previous MLB games to use to simulate out individual match ups.
<br><br>[home](#navigation)

## Marketing
The Marketing simulator provides two classes: ABTesting and Segmentation.  In both of these simulators a user can specify factors for the simulations to run off of.  This can be of use when putting together presentations on your expected outcome.
<br><br>[home](#navigation)

## Wildlife
Using the Wildlife simulator will allow you to create population models based on factors that are specified.
<br><br>[home](#navigation)

## KimmyGibler
Gibbs Sampling stuff.  There are other packages you can use to do this, and it's built on top of other packages, but this is meant to have things be easy for people to use.
